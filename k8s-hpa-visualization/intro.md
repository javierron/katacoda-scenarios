This demo helps to explain Kubernetes autoscaling feature. Auto-scaling is used to scale up and down the resources to align with the load. CPU utilisation is consistently monitored in the backend and when scale up the pods if the load increases. Not only that it also scale down the pods to match the exact requirements. Hence, saving the expensive resources. It ensures efficient performance of the system.

We will also set up visualization with [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus) to monitor our autoscaling deployment.
